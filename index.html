    <h1>Truth of Bakenstown</h1>
    <p>The name's Quincy.</p>
    <p>Lots of strange things have been happening regarding Bakenstown, Oregon, and I have a need to explain all of this.</p>
    <p>Most of what we do know comes from Bakenstown citizen Aloyoshenka Fadeaushka, who created a website explaining an incident regarding the destruction of Bakenstown.</p>
    <p>I'm going to show what he put on the site</p>
    <pre>"I've gathered these files and logs, and added information, in the interest for anyone to look in to this. I just want this to be over.
    Initially, there was a lot of excitement and interest withing QXUVUS. It seemed normal. But it is often when things are normal, something is going on.

    Things got weird, eventually. Bad things started occuring in Bakenstown, and the promotional images got stranger.

    There was no way anyone could deny they weren't going mad. Whoever was behind this, they had to have been mentally ill. Things were only starting, though.

    The Bakenstown Police got it inspected, as newer cases of poison related deaths had been popping up. The drink had INSANE levels of arsenic and cyanide, among other various poisons. Just a drop of that concoction was enough to kill anyone. The police released a statement:

    Finally, the police were going to investigate this case: or so we thought. For 2 weeks there was no sign of QXUVUS. But then something happened. A pedestrian claimed to have heard gunshots coming from the police station. The station then erupted into flames.
    Based on this information, I drew a conclusion: the guys behind this whole operation were arrested by the police but had managed to shoot them and commit arson to the station. By this point, we were all worried. This was getting abnormal.
    And then... I got an email.
    <a href="email.txt">email.txt</a>
    One thing from that email stood out to me. The elephant. That damned elephant. I knew it had to be connected to something.
    While taking a walk, I found a flash drive. I loaded it on my computer, and I found files relating to QXUVUS. These are the files I used to make this site.
    One file stood out to me. This.

    This is no normal organization. They are lunatics. For sure.
    They started destroying the city. Just obliterating it.
    I've escaped, but chances are I can't go far before they catch up.
    And so, I give you this to examine. If you want to keep up with me, I will here link my Twitter and a Discord server.

    My personal thanks to you for reading,

    <p>The contents of this site is factual indeed, but Aloyoshenka would undergo something strange.</p>
    <p>He was chased all around Oregon, and found a channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3qt4cExojsqxWkLrYh-esQ">Station82</a> telling of a county "Doke County". After going to Doke County, he found many oddities (that I think do exist)</p>
    <p>But then he was kidnapped and taken to an Isle of Laedare. I was also.</p>
    <p>We underwent a lot there. Me and other prisoners of QXUVUS escaped by boat.</p>
    <p>He tried to kill us. He tweeted that I was dead, but I was not. He lied about our position over the Pacific.</p>
    <p>He lied. I don't know where he is. I don't know what he did to the others. I managed to sail to Oregon.</p>
    <p>I know a bit of hacking. I seized all the accounts under a fake orginization:</p>
    <p><b>Center for Radio Tower Prevention</b></p>
    <p>I managed to get back to Bakenstown. I have ideas as to what is going on. Bad things are upon us. Please join <a href="https://discord.gg/ryBHKdYRcH">https://discord.gg/ryBHKdYRcH</a> to discuss further.</p>
